/**
 *Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.

Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.
* 
* Solution 1:
* 1)start from the root and compare the value and structure
* a) if the value of current node is same
* b) if there are same childs (left and right or whichever) of both
* 2)recursively iterate to the end, if any node is not same in value or structure, break and return false
